That is Perfection

Write a program to determine whether a number N is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors(excluding the number itself).
The first input is the number of test cases, followed by inputs one by one

Input format:

First line number of test cases followed by the inputs(N).

Output format:

Print YES ,if N is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors else print NO.

Constraints:

1≤T≤100

1≤N≤109

Sample Input

3

6

5

28

Sample output:

YES

NO

YES

Explanation:

6=1+2+3,so it is perfect

5=1,so it is not perfect

28=1+2+4+7+14,so it is perfect

 

 

For example:

Input	Result
2
28
59
YES
NO
