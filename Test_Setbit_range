Count set bits in a range 
Given a non-negative number n and two values I and r. The problem is to count the number of set bits in the range I to r in the binary representation of n, ie, to count set bits from the rightmost Ith bit to the rightmost rth bit. 
Constraint: 
1 <= 1 <= r <= number of bits in the binary representation of n. 
Examples: 
Input: n = 42 l = 2 r = 5 
Output: 2 
(42)10 (101010)2 
There are '2' set bits in the range 2 to 5. 
Input: n = 79 l = 1 r = 4 
Output: 4 
For example: 
Input 
42
2 5
Result 
2

input
68
2 5
result
1

input
4
1 2
result
0

input
79
1 4
result
4
