"""
 Given a set of numbers like we want to find sum of weights based on the following conditions

1. 5 if a perfect square

2. 4 if multiple of 4 and divisible by 6

3. 3 if even number

And sort the numbers based on the weight and print it as follows , Should display the numbers based on increasing order. If two numbers have the same weighted score, then the lowest of the two number is displayed first

Explanation

Weighted score of 25 = 5 (perfect square), 16 = 5+3,24 = 4+3, 21 = 0, 19=0

The increasing order would be 19,21,25,24,16

 
 
 
Sample Input

4

 

25 17 0 18
 Sample Output

 

17 18 25 0
 

 

 

 

For example:

Input	Result
4
25 17 0 18
17 18 25 0
""
