Given an integer array with 'N'(2<=n <=1000)points, find the distance between the closest pair of points

Example 1:

input 1: 3

input 2:{-10,0,11}

output :10

Explanation:

In the above example, the distance between -10 and 0 is 10,distance between -10 and 11 is 21, and between 0 and 11 is 11. So, the distance between the closest pair is 10.

Example 2:

input 1: 5

input 2:{10,2,-4,5,29}

output : 3

Explanation:

In the above example, the distance between 2 and 5 is 3,and between all other points is greater than 3. So, the distance between closest pair is 3.


Input Format
input 1: N, the number of points in an array

input 2: Array of numbers

Output Format
Return the distance between the closest pair of points

Sample Input
3
-10 0 11
Sample Output
10

For example:

Input	Result
3
-10 0 11
10
