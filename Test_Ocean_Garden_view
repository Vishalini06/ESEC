There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

The garden is on the left side of the building. a building has a garden view if all the buildings to the left have a smaller view.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an garden view, sorted in increasing order.

 

 

For example:

Input	
4,2,3,1
Result
[0,2,3]
[0]


in python
input
4,3,2,1
result 
[0,1,2,3]
[0]

input
1,2,3,4
result
